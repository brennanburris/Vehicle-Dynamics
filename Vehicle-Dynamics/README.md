This folder is for vehicle dynamics code. Much of it will be integrated with my TM file in the Tire Modelling folder. 

For right now, all I have in here is my Longitudinal Load Transfer model, which models Longitudinal LT with the help
of a tire model to give a maxium theoretical tire friction coefficient. 

Stay tuned for more updates!
