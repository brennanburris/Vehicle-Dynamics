This folder is for vehicle dynamics code. Much of it will be integrated with my TM file in the Tire Modelling folder. 

For right now, all I have in here is my Longitudinal Load Transfer model and my ride and roll rate model. 

The longLT function models Longitudinal LT with the help of my tire model to give a maxium theoretical tire friction 
coefficient as well as the longitudinal load transfer of a theoretical vehicle.

The ride roll calculator determines springs and bar sizes. 

Stay tuned for more updates!
